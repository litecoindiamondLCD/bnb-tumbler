This is a public script which has been audited and is used to make clean transactions to a new wallet.

This is a good script for people who want to hide where they got there busd from and it is even safer because you host the site so you can make it even more stealthy because your the one hosting it to the site.

I used this script many times personally and its very good it only tumbles a minimum of 50 busd so make sure you dont deposit less than 50 busd.

This script is very powerful and only should be used for educational purposes.
